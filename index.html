        I love reading books. Espically         mysteries are on the top of my reading list. Reading is a very good habit to pick up vocabularies, and is good for the brain before going to sleep. Instead of some game running in your mind book chracters can help you imagine in your mind. I also love reading fictions and graphic novels. They're also very fun to read. It's also better than playing in our phone all day. I love doing this hobby on my couch. I do have a lot of hobbies, but I love reading!

      <p2>I once read that Neil Armstrong read about 100 books, when he was little. So I want to be just like him!</p2>
